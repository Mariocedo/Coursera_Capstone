Given this small detail has such a high impact on the restaurant survivability, every businessman would be interested to know a priori where they should build their business. Which places have a higher tendency to lead to success and which ones are doomed to fail. \n\nTo have a general idea of what the problem entails, let us think about what type of location would be ideal. The new installations need to be in a good neighbourhood, one which is relatively quiet, but simultaneously crowded and with a sizeable crowd in order to increase the chances to find costumers. Moreover, it is best not to have too many restaurants around in order to decrease the competition between the different food establishments, but while also avoiding empty areas, or areas that are not associated with the business at hand.\n\nOverall, there is no ideal neighbourhood and there are no hard constraints. One needs to find the equilibrium between the different requirements. So as to solve the problem present, in this project we will develop and approach that relies on machine learning and data extraction tools in order to figure out whether a certain neighbourhood has potential for us to build our restaurant.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Data description\n\nThe study will focus on the area of Lisbon.\n\nWe will extract data from the listo of top 30 restaurants in Lisbon along with their addresses, from the zomato website (https://www.zomato.com/), as well as the list of bottom 30 restaurants (in ordert o have a means of comparison).\n\nWe will be using the tool foursquare, in order to get the location data from each restaurant.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Methodology\n\nHaving the Adresses and the respective location data from the restaurants, it will be necessary to properly clean it and prepare it for posterior analysis.\n\nAfterwards, we will be able to compare the data obtained from foursquare and try to identify trends among the similar restaurantes and differences between the two different kinds.\n\nMoreover, we will be able to build machine learning models, such as decision trees, that will help us determine wether or not a certain location is fit to have a new restaurant."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Week 5"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
